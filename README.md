# Healthcare Comment Analysis
We use a labelled dataset of web comments regarding healthcare services/clinics to determine whether each comment is relevant to a given topic, e.g. Effective Treatment, using TensorFlow neural networks.

There is a single notebook that includes:
1. Cleaning and processing the comment text.
2. Building and training the models.
3. Evaluating model performance.
